# Analog board: a voltage on an ADC pad

ESP32-C3 firmware reading one ADC pad, run by `esp-emu` with no hardware and
no browser, against either of two parts:

- `board.json`: a potentiometer, [`examples/parts/potentiometer`](../../parts/potentiometer),
  its wiper on GPIO 3.
- `thermistor.json`: an NTC thermistor divider,
  [`examples/parts/ntc_thermistor`](../../parts/ntc_thermistor), its output on
  GPIO 3.

GPIO 3 is ADC1 channel 3 on the C3. The firmware uses the stock `adc_oneshot`
driver at 12 dB and the chip's curve-fitting calibration; it does not know the
voltage comes from a part.

## Run it from a release

Download two files from the
[latest release](https://github.com/espressif/esp-emulator/releases/latest):
the emulator for your computer, `esp-emu-<version>-<platform>.tar.gz`, and the
examples kit, `esp-emu-<version>-examples.tar.gz`. Unpack both. The kit's
`analog/` folder holds this board, ready to run:

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `board.json` | the knob: a potentiometer with its wiper on GPIO 3 |
| `thermistor.json` | the thermistor: an NTC divider with its output on GPIO 3 |
| `potentiometer.wasm`, `ntc_thermistor.wasm` | the parts |
| `adc_oneshot-esp32c3.bin` | the firmware: [`test_apps/adc_oneshot`](../../../test_apps/adc_oneshot) for esp32c3 |

In that folder:

```sh
/path/to/esp-emu --chip esp32c3 --firmware adc_oneshot-esp32c3.bin \
    --cosim-board board.json --control-tcp 127.0.0.1:5556
```

The knob starts half way, 1650 mV. The firmware reads it three times,
`ADC: read=0 raw=2409 mv=1640`, prints `ADC_ONESHOT: done`, then a reading
every second. The millivolts are the calibration scheme's: it takes 10 mV off
at this voltage on the C3, so 1650 reads as 1640. In a second terminal,
connect to the emulator's control channel:

```sh
nc 127.0.0.1 5556
```

and type this line, followed by Enter:

```text
part knob input more
```

It answers `ok`, and the next reading is `ADC: raw=2891 mv=1962`, the wiper at
60 %, 1980 mV. `less` turns it back 10 %, and `set:position=20` puts it at
20 %. Ctrl-C closes `nc`; the emulator keeps running.

With `--cosim-board thermistor.json` the pad carries the thermistor instead.
It starts at 25 °C, which is also 1650 mV; `part ntc input set:temperature=50`
moves the output to 871 mV, and `warmer` and `cooler` move it a degree at a
time. The voltage falls as the thermistor warms.

## What you can send

One command a line, one answer a line:

| Command | Answer |
|---|---|
| `part list` | `ok knob` (or `ok ntc`) |
| `part knob input more`, `less` | `ok` |
| `part knob input set:position=20` | `ok`; that position, in percent |
| `part ntc input warmer`, `cooler`, `set:temperature=37.5` | `ok` |
| `part knob state` | `ok` and the knob's `position` and `millivolts` |
| `part clock` | `ok MS`: emulated time |

`--cosim-log events.jsonl` records every voltage the part put on the pad, as
`AnalogDrive` with its `pin` and `millivolts`.

## Build the pieces yourself

- The parts: [`examples/parts/potentiometer`](../../parts/potentiometer) and
  [`examples/parts/ntc_thermistor`](../../parts/ntc_thermistor) say how.
- The firmware, with ESP-IDF: in `test_apps/adc_oneshot`,
  `idf.py set-target esp32c3 build merge-bin -o merged_flash.bin` gives
  `build/merged_flash.bin`.

Put them next to the board files, the firmware as `adc_oneshot-esp32c3.bin`,
and run as above. Built for an ESP32-C5, C6 or H2 the firmware reads GPIO 3 as
well (ADC1 channel 2 on the C5 and H2); for an ESP32-S31 it reads GPIO 43 at
0 dB, so a board for it wires the part's pin there. The H2's emulated eFuse
carries no ADC calibration, so on the H2 the firmware prints raw codes only.
The P4 and the S3 refuse an analog part: their ADC is not modelled yet. To
write a part of your own, see [docs/guides/PARTS.md](../../../docs/guides/PARTS.md).
